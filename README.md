Trading system bitmm.go makes a two-sided market around a volume-and-time-weighted moving average of traded prices. The width of the market adjusts based on volatility, and order quantities are adjusted based on position. The system is functional and can be run autonomously but is not intended as a turn-key system for general use. 

Environment variables BITFINEX_KEY and BITFINEX_SECRET are needed for use.
