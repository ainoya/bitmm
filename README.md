Trading system bitmm.go makes a two-sided market around a volume-and-time-weighted moving average of traded prices. The width of the market adjusts based on volatility, and position management is fully automated. The system is functional and can be run autonomously but is not intended as a turn-key system for general use.

Configuration settings are in bitmm.gcfg. Environment variables BITFINEX_KEY and BITFINEX_SECRET are needed for exchange access.
