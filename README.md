Toy trading system for the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange.

The system makes a two-sided market around a volume-and-time-weighted moving average of traded prices. The width of the market adjusts with volatility, and order quantities are adjusted on fills. The system is functional and can be run autonomously but is not intended as a turn-key system for general use. The system was profitable on a small scale in Litecoin but I have since focused on inter-exchange arbitrage.

Environment variables BITFINEX_KEY and BITFINEX_SECRET are needed for use.
